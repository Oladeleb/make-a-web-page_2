   <p>
     The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of HTLM documents.
   Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the language used to write web pages- A glue that ties all file 
  t ypes, images video, pictures, etc.  together in a readable format.  
     <p>
    As a user, when you go to a webpage like <a href= "www.udacity.com">udacity</a>,  the Web browser and 
    Web server use Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with each other over the Internet. 
    The web browser connects to the webserver, the webserver sends request to HTTP for the designated webpage.
    The webserver receives the web browserâ€™s request and then sends it via HTTP, if the page exists.

     Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is use to write webpages. HTML is made up of "text content", what you see,
    and   <em> "mark up" </em>which describes how "what you see" looks like, references to links, images, video, etc.

      <div class="topic-content">
      <p>
      Inline elements are displayed without a line break, so you can have multiple inline elements on the same horizontal line of a page. Block elements are displayed with a line break, so you can't have multiple block elements on the same horizontal line unless you declare display: flex. All elements, inline and block, have an invisible box around them that you can target via CSS.

  <p> 
  HTML page structure comprises of three parts: HTML version, a Head section and the Body.
  HTML version declares what version of HTML is being used. The Head section contains metadata about
  the current document, such as, cascading style sheet (css), document title, etc. The Body section contains the page content that is visible to users.
</p>
<p>
     To view a website page structure, use google chrome developer tools, for example, to show 
    the website page structure as the browser interpret it. As you mouse over an element within a structure,
    the section of the page is highlighted for readiability.

  <b>The "Tree-like Structure of HTML"</b>

       <div class="topic-content">
      <p> Every browser builds a tree-like structure of a page. HTML tree is hierarchical in nature, where some of the root(parent) attributes are inherited by it dependents(child) and this can be seen by expanding or collapsing the parent record to show or hide related content. The DOM(Document Object Model) defines the tree-structure of a page.
